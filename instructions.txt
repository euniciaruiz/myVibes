Clone first the myvibes repository in Github

Plugin
1. Source code for the plugin by Peteris Krumin: winamp-plugin-digitalpoint-music-reporter/src directory
2. Download Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate to be able to run/edit the plugin.
   Once you've downloaded VS2010 Ultimate, open the plugin using the said software.
4. Open and read the compile.txt found inside the winamp-plugin-digitalpoint-music-reporter folder.
   Follow the instructions for compiling libcurl.
   
Note: 
   I downloaded the latest libcurl version and included it inside the myvibes folder that you have just cloned. -> curl-7.37.0.tar.gz
   If you encounter './libcurl directory', this is actually the 'winamp-plugin-digitalpoint-music-reporter/libcurl' directory.
   Next, you are also required to run the following:
   > vcvars32
   > nmake vc
   Use the Visual Studio Command Prompt 2010 for running the commands. Just find this cmd in your computer.

5. Next, set up LibCurl in Visual Studio 2010. The plugin needs to know the location of libcurl since it uses some 
   of its features. Just visit this site 'http://www.bloglovin.com/viewer?post=994883165&group=0&frame_type=b&blog=7363143&frame=1&click=0&user=0'

Setting up the MyVibes system in your computer [Note: We're going to use Bitnami Wappstack]
1. Create a database and name it 'myvibes'. Go to myvibes folder and there you will find a file
   named 'queries'. If you want to see for yourself the myvibes database schema, refer to the Chapter 5 of d3revesion
   and check if there's something wrong with any of the queries.
2. Put the myvibes folder inside this directory: BitNami WAPPStack\apache2\htdocs.
3. Go to myvibes->class and edit 'pgsql_db.class.php'
   Change the username and password according to the configuration of your postgreSQL database.
   Now, open your browser then type this 'localhost/myvibes' and create an account.
   Once you're redirected to index.php, you will notice two errors. To resolve these, just follow the next instruction.
4. The following are the php scripts, which need to be edited:

-> Go to includes and edit 'authenticate.inc.php':

Replace 

session_start(); 

to this

if(!isset($_SESSION)) { 
	session_start(); 
}

Restart the page and one problem down. Next

-> Go to includes and edit 'loginreq.php':

Comment or delete this line of code: include "class/pgsql_db.class.php";

-> Open index.php and profile.php and include this code to those two scripts: include "class/pgsql_db.class.php".
   If you encouter the same problem as you navigate through the myvibes system just use the solution provided above to resolve it.
